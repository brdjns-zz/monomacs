INSTALL

These instructions should work on Debian GNU/Linux, Arch Linux and Ubuntu.
If your distribution has bitmap fonts disabled you have two options available to
you: you can can reenable them globally or enable only Monomacs for use in
X11 applications. This guide provides instructions for the latter.

Place Monomacs-13.bdf in either your ~/.fonts directory for your own use,
or /usr/share/fonts for all users. Before you can use it you have to whitelist it
so that X11 knows to use it.

Visit a new file:

$ sudo touch /etc/fonts/conf.d/50-enable-monomacs.conf

and write the following to it:

<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
  <selectfont>
    <acceptfont>
      <pattern>
        <patelt name="family"><string>monomacs</string></patelt>
      </pattern>
    </acceptfont>
  </selectfont>
</fontconfig>

Finally, update your font cache to make the font available for use:

$ fc-cache -vf
